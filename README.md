# MBP_TR_PartB
This repository contains the code developed for calculating the optimal MBP scheme under user heterogeneity



## Setup
Ensure that you have installed Matlab 2022 or a later version on your laptop. The code requires the Parallel Computing Toolbox for Matlab.

Make sure that your current directory in Matlab is set to the folder containing the code.

##  Usage
To calculate the optimal MBP scheme using the SBO method proposed in our paper, open the file Optimal_Priority_Different_SP.m in Matlab. Select a demand case from Cases 1-3 or the demand case from Van den Berg and Verhoef (2011) by modifying line 13.

Once ready, click "Run" in Matlab. A window will appear, dynamically displaying the solution for each iteration. When the calculation is complete, type "Y" in the Matlab command window if you'd like to save the solution.
