# MBP_TR_PartB
This repository contains the code developed for calculating the optimal MBP scheme under user heterogeneity


## Setup

Make sure you have installed Matlab 2022 or later versions on your laptop. The code will invoke the Parallel Computing Toolbox for matlab. 


## Usage 

To calculate the optimal MBP scheme with the SBO method proposed in our paper, you can open the file "Optimal_Priority_Different_SP.m" in Matlab. Choose a demand case from Cases 1 -3 and the demand case adopted from van den Berg and Verhoef (2011) by revising line 13.
